# Eat-Da-Burger

using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM i'll be creating a Burger logger with 2 main functions:

Devour it: 

Each burger has a "Devour it!" button that when clicked will update the mysql database to show it has been devoured. The burger name will move to the right side of the screen. Indicating to the user the burger has been eaten.

Creat it:

The user inputs the name of the burger in the textbox they want to create that will be added to the mysql database and rendered on the left side of the screen.
